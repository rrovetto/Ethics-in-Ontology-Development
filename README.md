# Ethics in Ontology Development & Use
Research and development into ethical, moral and social considerations of various aspects of ontologies and ontology development. If you find value in my work, please [support/donate here](https://gogetfunding.com/knowledge-organization-services-ontology-terminology-metadata-concept-analysis/).

## Goals
- A set of ethical principles for ontology development
- To correct [misinformation and myths](https://github.com/rrovetto/Ethical-Ontology-Development/blob/master/Myths-Of-Ontology-Development.md) of ontology development and use
- To increase moral awareness and responsibility in semantic-related communities
- To increase user awareness of the semantics and underlying viewpoints within ontologies they (users) may use
- To ensure fairness, equal opportunity among ontologies in the community. 

## Preliminary Points
- Historically, and in modernity, 'ontology' (in the original and non-computaitonal sense) is the generic study of existence. As such, various ontological theories/accounts oftem make fundamental and profound claims about the nature of the world. Therefore, if any aspect of that endeavor (and its metaphysical questions) transfers to contemporary computational ontology where our personal and societal data (of all kinds), then there is a necessary moral imperative to understand what computational ontologies are claiming about the world, and how they are classifying and describing things. Many models, and many classifications, are possible. For these reason, it is both more ethical to not use any computational ontology that imposes any metaphysical worlview.  
- If ontologies are, in part, about stating the things that are either of interest or presumed to exist, then you should be informed whether a given ontology is inclusive of what you, your data, or your organnization believes to exist. Be aware whether an ontology accepts, or miscategorizes/micharacterizes the things you want to include in an ontology. 
- Your mental model should not be forced under, or changed into, that of another ontology or it's developers, at least not without your consent.
- Question worth exploring: is raw data empty of inherent semantics? is all raw data open to semantic interpretation? do we ascribe semantics to datasets and individual data elements? If datasets or data elements collected from some source do not have any inherent or unique semantics, then it would be ethical to not exclusively associate a single semantics (e.g., a metadata set, or an ontology annotating that data) to that data.
