For Users of Ontologies

- **Awareness 1** - Be aware of the assumptions, worldviews (philosophical or otherwise), ontological commmitments, intended semantics of the ontology. This can be achieved by doing research on the candidate ontologies and directly asking their developers. 
- **Awareness 2** - Be aware of all imported ontologies, and apply Awareness 1 to them. This can be achieved by doing research on the candidate ontologies and directly asking their developers.

For Developers & Owners of Ontologies
- **Transparency 1** - Explicitly disclose (to the intended audience, including users, data owners, stakeholders, etc.) all assumptions, worldviews (philosophical or otherwise), ontological commitments, intended semantics of the ontology.
- **Transparency 2** - Explicitly disclose the imported ontologies (to the intended audience, including users, data owners, stakeholders, etc.) and their assumptions et al.
