For Users of Ontologies

- **Awareness 1** - Be aware of the assumptions, worldviews (philosophical or otherwise), ontological commmitments, intended semantics of the ontology. This can be achieved by doing research on the candidate ontologies and directly asking their developers. 
- **Awareness 2** - Be aware of all imported ontologies, and apply Awareness 1 to them. This can be achieved by doing research on the candidate ontologies and directly asking their developers.
- Do not pidgeon-hole your topic/domain, data elements, concepts, terminology, terms, categories, etc., under (the model of) the ontology. 
- Do not use or adopt an ontology if you do not agree with how it models the topic/domain/concepts/data, i.e., if you don't agree with its assumptions, worldviews (...), ontological commitments, intended semantics, etc.  
- Do not use or adopt an ontology if you do not agree with how its imported ontologies model the topic/domain/concepts/data
- Do not use or adopt an ontology because of a perceived large user-base. It is an invalid argument for an ontology that a large user-base equates to a useful or accurate ontology.

For Developers & Owners of Ontologies
- **Transparency 1** - Explicitly disclose (to the intended audience, including users, data owners, stakeholders, etc.) all assumptions, worldviews (philosophical or otherwise), ontological commitments, intended semantics of the ontology.
- **Transparency 2** - Explicitly disclose the imported ontologies (to the intended audience, including users, data owners, stakeholders, etc.) and their assumptions et al.
- Do not use logical fallacies or invalid arguments to attempt gaining users of your ontology: 
-   do not appeal to popularity (e.g., having a large user-base), 
-   authority (e.g., having an ontology published in a standards organization or as a standard),
