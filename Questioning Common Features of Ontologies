## On Agreement

Ontologies are often described as being examples of common agreement (of a vocabulary, its definitions; of a worldview, of a model of the target domain of interest, etc.); or as aiming to reach consensus.

## Consensus 

An often-stated feature of ontologies is their expressing consensus on the model, vocabulary, or the represented knowledge (modeling consensual knowledge), etc., i.e. agreement of some sort. 

## Critical questioning & Verification of claims to consensus: 
- We must ask and determine: Is there, actually, agreement/consensus? Was it reached? If so, how? What was the population (the community among which consensus was reached)? Did all member of the population agree? Was there diversity of views and opinions? Or was the population cherry-picked for common worldview?
