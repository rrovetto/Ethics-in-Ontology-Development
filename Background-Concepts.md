### 1. There are Many Theories & Many starting assumptions

- In general, there are many ways to model something, whether the model is a conceptual model, computable model, or otherwise. 
- Formal ontology is an _abstract_ and _analytical_ branch of metaphysics that characterizes a given topic or set of concepts using formal logics in a highly generic, often domain-independent manner. It often aims to identify invariant features of things (broadly construed). A formal ontology is effectively a model, account or theory consisting of that characterization. 
- Both formal ontology and ontology engineering in computer and information science (e.g. in AI) often involve creating models, accounts, or theories. 

Because these are typically analytical activities, their resultant models or theories may vary, but begin with assumptions. Those assumptions may be logical, metaphysical (philosophical ontology), or otherwise. 

**Therefore, you should always take any ontological model with a grain of salt. Remember that there can be many models for the target topic, dataset, or concept.**
For example, mereology is the study of parts and their wholes, using formal meethods such as symbolic logic. Each mereological account may begin with a different set of assumptions. Therefore there is no single theory of mereology, but more than one depending on first principles, etc. 

### 2. Conceptual & Abstract Distinctions

The **Generic vs. Specific** distinction is a common, and perhaps fundamental, distinction used in many disciplines. It is ubiquitous in ontology and semantic web technology. It stems from ancient intellectual inquiry, e.g., philosophical inquiry, and has resulted in contemporary distinctions in mathematics, computer and information science such as:
class vs. member, 
set vs. element, 
category vs. individual
...
The readers is encouraged to look at Type theory and others to understand related formal concepts.
