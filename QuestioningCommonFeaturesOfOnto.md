## On Agreement

Ontologies are often described as aiming for or being examples of common agreement: agreement of the given formal vocabulary; the intended meaning or definitions of the constituent terms; of the coneptual, semantic, ontological or knowledge model; of one or more worldviews; of a specific model of the target domain of interest, etc. They are described as aiming to reach consensus, which is then encoded and made shareable for use or reuse.

### Consensus 

An often-stated feature of ontologies is their expressing consensus on the model, vocabulary, or the represented knowledge (modeling consensual knowledge), etc., i.e. agreement of some sort. 

### Critical questioning & Verification of claims to consensus: 
- We must ask and determine: Is there, actually, agreement/consensus? Was it reached? If so, how? What was the population (the community among which consensus was reached)? Did all member of the population agree? Was there diversity of views and opinions? Or was the population cherry-picked for common worldview?
